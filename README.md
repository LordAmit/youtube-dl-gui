youtube-dl-gui
==============
Made it because I needed the capability to set output format of the video to be downloaded.

## Setup

You need pyside to run the script. For ubuntu (and its other variants), you can install pyside by this command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-pyside
```

Ensure that the youtube-dl-gui.py is marked as executable. Double click on it. 

## Dependencies

1. pyside
2. gnome-terminal (to run youtube-dl commands)

You can easily change the gnome-terminal part with your favorite terminal by editing the youtube-dl-gui.py file.
